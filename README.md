## Hi there 👋

I'm an Associate Professor in Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and Associate Biophysicist, McLean Hospital and Director of the Technical and Instrumentation Core at the Brain Imaging Center. I received a BS in Physics from Yale University and a PhD in Biophysics from the University of California at Berkeley, back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. My training is in MR physics, and my PhD thesis is entitled “Three Dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of Sodium Ions Using Stochastic Excitation and Oscillating Gradients”. If the stochastic NMR with oscillating gradients is the solution to your problem, I'd gently suggest finding a different problem.

I'm the Director of the McLean Hospital Opto Magnetic Group, and my research is focused on multimodal acquisition and processing for hemodynamic quantitation and physiological denoising of BOLD and NIRS data.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on trying to convince people that they _really_ should use rapidtide to properly denoise their fMRI and NIRS data.  Double your SNR for no money!
- 💬 Ask me about physiological noise, but only if you are either 1) actually interested or 2) need a sleep aid.
